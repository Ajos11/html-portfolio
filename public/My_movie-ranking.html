<h1>My favorite romance movies -- Anuj Joshi</h1>
<h2>The list includes : </h2>
<hr />

<h3>La la land</h3>
<p>This movie is particularly visually stunning and 
includes breathtaking dance sequences and chemistry.</p>
<h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
<p>The movie feels like a cool breeze flowing through
your body and you are in just awe of that feeling that 
you feel in your body and just want to enjoy that moment 
till it lasts.</p>
<h3>Notting Hill</h3>
<p>It's a movie based on experiences between two individuals
whose lives are polar opposites according to their statuses in
society and how when they meet a void in their life seems to be
ful-filled.</p>
